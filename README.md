# team_profile_generator
## Description
This app allows people to answer prompts about a team of workers and then recieve a generated HTML webpage of their profile. This project was an exercise in using modules and classes in javascript which proved to be useful in terms of organizing and simplifying code. This project also was my first instance of testing in javascript. I have tested before in java and python, so it was interesting to see the differences between the languages. I would say that testing in javascript is generally harder since it requires importing libraries to do effectively, while testing in java or python is more built in.
